# ![Frontend Conference HOKKAIDO Calendar](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/843412541/84cc9a7b-510e-4ca9-8eb0-be295c0ce265) [![tests](https://github.com/jsakamoto/frontendconf-do-calendar/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jsakamoto/frontendconf-do-calendar/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

 Exposing the session schedules of [Frontend Conference HOKKAIDO](https://www.frontend-conf.jp/) as iCal
        calendar feed.
## Usage

You can subscribe to the calendar feed by using the following URL:

```
https://frontend-conf-do-calendar.azurewebsites.net/ical/v1
```

## How it works

This is a simple [ASP.NET Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis) application on **.NET 8**. The calendar feed is generated by scraping the session schedules from the [Frontend Conference HOKKAIDO timetablet](https://fortee.jp/frontend-conf-hokkaido-2024/timetable). The scraping is done by using [AngleSharp](https://anglesharp.github.io/) and the calendar feed is generated by using [Ical.Net](https://github.com/rianjs/ical.net). The calendar feed is hosted on [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/).
